A servo consists of a motor, gearbox, position sensor, and a control circuit. For the music box, we just need the motor and gears. The control circuit can be removed and the gears modified to allow continuous rotation.

A micro servo case is held together with small but long screws; remove these and any stickers that stop you opening the case. Open the case slowly as the parts may fall out.

Open the back of the servo and pull out the small circuit board. Cut or desolder the three wires connected to the potentiometer. Cut or desolder the two wires that are connected to the motor. Remove the circuit board. Solder a 0.1 μF capacitor across the motor terminals and attach two wires that lead out of the case.

Close up this side of the motor and open the opposite side. The main output gear has two features that stop it from rotating continuously. The first is a peg on the underside. This will clash with the other gears if it rotates too far. The second is a flat area on the potentiometer shaft that aligns with a D-shaped hole in the gear. Carefully round off the hole in the output gear: you can do this with a small flat-bladed screwdriver. Cut off the peg. Replace the gear on the gear train and rotate the second gear in the train to check that it can complete a full revolution.
